# HackUtdDoc
Create new project for HackUTD

## Inspiration
Health care is very important in people’s life, in the United State, when people need health care, they need to drive very far from their house to see a doctor. Sometimes people don’t have the ability to drive to the hospital. So, here we create a Match Doc System, which links patients to doctors or medical students. The patients can receive professional advice in their home, furthermore,  they can get prescriptions from doctors and go to nearest pharmacy (for example, CVS pharmacy) to get their medicine. Our system will also benefit doctors and medical students by producing more working opportunity and working experience.

## What it does
Patient users can use our app to input their basic information and disease symptoms, we will send these information to our backend. Our system will predict patient's disease to find in state or best score doctors that can give professional advice to the patient users. Our backend will send the recommended doctors back to the user, and they can get best advice from the best doctors!

## How we built it
We use **Python** to build our system. We also use **MongoDB** to save patients' symptoms.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrate frontend and backend system.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We create a algorithm to recommend best doctors to the users.
* We learn new frontend building tools and use in our project. 

## What we learned
* New frontend building tools.
* Build a new system in 24 hours.
* Collaboration with other teammates.
* Inspire our potential.

## What's next for Match Doc
Expand our doctor dataset with real doctors' data, and embed video stream between patient and doctor or medical student.
